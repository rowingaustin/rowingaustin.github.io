                    Outdoor water use is the focus of several conservation initiatives because it represents the majority, 56-percent, of our total residential water use. <br><br>

                        Following are a few quick tips to help conserve water outdoors:
                            <ul>
                                <li>Adjust your sprinkler system seasonally, using the following as a suggested watering guide:
                                    Winter (December – January): No irrigation needed
                                    Early Spring (February – March): Once a week
                                    Spring (April – May): Twice a week
                                    Summer (June – August): Three times a week
                                    Fall (September – October): Twice a week
                                    Late Fall (November): Once a week</li>
                                <li>Avoid watering from 8 a.m. to 8 p.m. in the summer months, in accordance with time of day watering recommendations</li>
                                <li>Adjust sprinkler heads so they don’t spray walls, driveways or sidewalks</li>
                                <li>Monitor how many minutes you can run your sprinkler system before water begins to run off the property. Make adjustments as needed
                                    To eliminate run off, break-up the total watering time using the multiple start function on the controller leaving about an hour in between each cycle allowing water to soak into the soil</li>
                                <li>Raise your lawn mower blade to 2.5 or 3 inches</li>
                                <li>Use turf grass sparingly</li>
                                <li>Core-aerate your soil annually</li>
                                <li>Hand water dry spots</li>
                                <li>Use the most efficient types of nozzles and irrigation clocks</li>
                                <li>Check the sprinkler system weekly and immediately replace broke or missing sprinklers</li>
                                <li>Use a drip irrigation system to water trees and shrubs</li>
                                <li>Check your drip line monthly for breaks and clogged or missing emitter heads</li>
                                <li>Use plants that are tolerant to this climate (see Water Wise Plants for Utah Landscapes)</li>
                                <li>Group plants according to their watering needs</li>
                                <li>Avoid lawn on steep slopes</li>

                                <li>Minimize or eliminate fertilizer</li>
                                <li>Cover pools to eliminate approximately 10,000 to 15,000 gallons of water lost every year to evaporation</li>
